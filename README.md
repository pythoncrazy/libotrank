# Lichess Bot Ranking Site

## Setup
- Create a Supabase account, and create tables WITH THE SAME NAME AS THE FORMATS (aka tables with name 'blitz', 'bullet' etc. without the quotes). I haven't gotten around to adding support for custom table names. Additionally, create a table with name 'list-of-bots' without quotes.
